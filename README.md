# 💫 About Me

I’m an AWS Certified Cloud Engineer and DevOps specialist with expertise in **multi-cloud architecture**, **Kubernetes (EKS)**, and **serverless solutions**. I excel in designing **secure, scalable systems** using **AWS**, **Terraform**, and **CI/CD pipelines**.

As a recognized **AWS Community Builder**, I’ve helped modernize infrastructure through **GitOps (ArgoCD)**, **centralized logging (LokiStack)**, and **cloud cost optimization** (up to 75% savings). I’m skilled in **Python**, **Docker**, and **AI/ML tools**, and passionate about delivering automation, supporting cross-region migrations, and contributing to the open-source and cloud communities.
